Tuntunpa:
	->Seems close to what I had in mind
	->Not available in Android Play Store
	->Seems to be still available in Apple Store but last update was on 2017
	->Website abandoned
	->Last update on Facebook page was on 2017

RockU:
	->Exactly what I had in mind
	->Not a single event added

	CONCLUSION: Looks like it has been abandoned

Bandsintown:
	->Fans are not notified when events are added to venues
	->If venue is not verified in facebook event has to be manually added both in event venue and artist
	  (Be verified on facebook requires at least 1k likes or a blue badge)
	->"Promote" feature: notifies fans with similar taste, not free

	CONCLUSION: More focused on artists than venues, our real goal is notify people what's happening on their area today, not
		    when an specific artist comes close

Dice:
	->Events are added using a form
	->Users cannot follow venues

	CONCLUSION: Strongly focused on artists and selling tickets

Yelp:
	->Lists venues that can be filtered with live music. However it doesn't show when actually there's an event or who is playing.
	->It also has a map with venues location that I think can be useful for the app	

	NOTE: It can be useful to find live music bars to whom app can be interesting.

Songkick:
	->Seems to aim to big venues, not small jam sessions
	->User cannot track locations or limit location radius on search

Chooseyourevent:
	->Only for USA and UK
	->Only website
	->Seems to be adequate for small venues	
	->Broad range of event types, not focused on music
	->Cannot define a radius filter on search
	->More focused on venues than other options

Xceed:
	->I like the user interface: user can search directly in map, user can follow venues,...
	->User cannot search a venue by its name, but he can filter it by type
	->Focused on club events rather than live music pubs/small venues
	->Adding events seems tedious and not scalable. A form is used to add a single event where you have to add venue name
	  location, and artists without an enumeration or autocompletion. There are also a bunch of other useless fields.
