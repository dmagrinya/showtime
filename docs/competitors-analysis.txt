Tuntunpa:
    ->It was only available for a few spanish cities
	->Seems close to what I had in mind
	->Not available in Android Play Store
	->Seems to be still available in Apple Store but last update was on 2017
	->Website abandoned
	->Last update on Facebook page was on 2017

RockU:
    ->It looks like it aims to USA cities
	->Exactly what I had in mind
	->Not a single event added

Bandsintown:
	->Fans are not notified when events are added to venues
	->If venue is not verified in facebook event has to be manually added both in event venue and artist
	  (Be verified on facebook requires at least 1k likes or a blue badge)
	->"Promote" feature: notifies fans with similar taste, not free

Dice:
	->Events are added using a form
	->Users cannot follow venues

Songkick:
	->Seems to aim to big venues, not small jam sessions
	->User cannot track locations or limit location radius on search

Xceed:
	->I like the user interface: user can search directly in map, user can follow venues,...
	->User cannot search a venue by its name, but he can filter it by type
	->Focused on club events rather than live music pubs/small venues
	->Adding events seems tedious and not scalable. A form is used to add a single event where you have to add venue name
	  location, and artists without an enumeration or autocompletion. There are also a bunch of other useless fields. 

Chooseyourevent:
	->Only for USA and UK
	->Only website
	->Seems to be adequate for small venues	
	->Broad range of event types, not focused on music
	->Cannot define a radius filter on search
	->More focused on venues than other options

Yelp:
	->Lists venues that can be filtered with live music. However it doesn't show when actually there's an event or who is playing.
	->It also has a map with venues location that I think can be useful for the app	

CONCLUSIONS:

    The closest apps to the idea I have in mind seem to be abandoned (RockU and Tuntunpa). It could be particularly useful find out why Tuntunpa failed, since one of the cities supported was Barcelona.

	Most of the currently active apps are focused on artists rather than venues, and specially on big events/venues (BandsinTown, Dice, Songkick, Xceed). Our real goal is inform the user what are his options on his area today, not if an specific artist is playing close.
    
    I noticed that adding events for some apps must be really painful, not scalable at all (Dice, Xceed). I linke Bandsintown approach on this regard, it offers a bulky way to intoduce data through an Excel sheet template.

	An important feature for some currently active apps, like DICE, seems to be selling tickets.

	The app/website Yelp can be useful to find live music bars to whom Showtime can be interesting.
